# Overview
This repository contains the MATLAB and python codes used to simulate a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons according to the discriptions in Hoseini et al., Dynamics and sources of response variability and its coordination in visual cortex (2019).

Our goal is to provide full transparency and to enable readers to read it and find out the exact details of what was done.
